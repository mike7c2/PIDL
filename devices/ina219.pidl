device:
    name: INA219
    description: >
        The INA219 is a current shunt and power monitor 
        with an I2C- or SMBUS-compatible interface. The 
        device monitors both shunt voltage drop and bus 
        supply voltage, with programmable conversion times 
        and filtering. A programmable calibration value, 
        combined with an internal multiplier, enables direct 
        readouts of current in amperes. An additional 
        multiplying register calculates power in watts. The I 2C- or SMBUS-compatible interface features 16 
        programmable addresses. 
        The INA219 is available in two grades: A and B. The 
        B grade version has higher accuracy and higher 
        precision specifications. 
        The INA219 senses across shunts on buses that can 
        vary from 0 to 26 V. The device uses a single 3- to 
        5.5-V supply, drawing a maximum of 1 mA of supply 
        current. The INA219 operates from –40°C to 125°C.
